example_043,"The terminology of algebraic geometry changed drastically with the introduction of the general methods, initiated by a mathematician of what nationality?",German,"The terminology of algebraic geometry changed drastically with the introduction of the general methods, initiated by a mathematician of what nationality?

The answer is Italian, because it was the first to introduce the general methods of algebraic geometry, including schemes, and to generalize the concept of algebraic variety from rings to general varieties of algebras.

The Italian school of algebraic geometry, which initiated the general concept of algebraic geometry in the 19th century, was founded by Giuseppe Peano, Luigi Galilei, and Cesare Vitale, along with Italian mathematician Andrea Marini.

Giuseppe Peano, Luigi Galilei, and Cesare Vitale were all Italian mathematicians and were influential figures in the development of algebraic geometry. They were pioneers in the field and established the foundations for the modern study of algebraic geometry.

Andrea Marini, who was a naturalized Italian mathematician, was a crucial figure in the development of algebraic geometry. He introduced the concept of scheme, which is the modern version of the algebraic variety.

Italian mathematicians such as Andrea Marini, Giusep","The terminology of algebraic geometry changed drastically during the twentieth century, with the introduction of the general methods, initiated by David Hilbert and the Italian school of algebraic geometry in the beginning of the century, and later formalized by André Weil, Serre and Grothendieck.; In universal algebraic geometry, algebraic geometry is generalized from the geometry of rings to geometry of arbitrary varieties of algebras, so that every ""variety of algebra"" has its own algebraic geometry.;  In it, Grothendieck established systematic foundations of algebraic geometry, building upon the concept of schemes, which he defined.",77.8537,53986.99,53971.21,7.1,50.1,0,1,0,0.0,"The terminology of algebraic geometry changed drastically with the introduction of the general methods, initiated by a mathematician of what nationality?

The Italian mathematician André Weil, also known as Weil II, was a prominent figure in the development of algebraic geometry, but did not make a significant impact on its terminology. Serre was another prominent mathematician whose work on algebraic geometry had a significant impact on the terminology. Grothendieck, on the other hand, was a mastermind in the development of algebraic geometry and helped to establish the concept of a scheme, which is still used today.

This answer uses the provided context to directly answer the question. It uses a comparison of the nationality of Weil and Serre and their contributions to algebraic geometry, and then adds that Grothendieck was the most influential due to his work on schemes.

To find the city, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the county seat location:
   - The county seat in Mississippi is Jackson, Mississippi.
2. Calculate the coordinates of the county seat and the city:
   - The city is five miles west of the county seat, so we can use Pythagoras' theorem to calculate the coordinates.
3. Find the county where the city is located:
   - To do this, we can use a map or a geocoding service to find the coordinates of the city and then compare with the coordinates of each county's border.

To calculate the coordinates of the city using Pythagoras' theorem, we need to know the length of the hypotenuse (5 miles) and the angle between the hypotenuse and the adjacent side (the distance from the county seat to the city). Since the hypotenuse is 5 miles, we can use the cosine rule to find the length of the opposite side (the distance of the city from the county seat).

The libretto is based on the opera ""A Rake's Progress"" by Igor Stravinsky, which itself has been performed by Nico van der Meel.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the libretto relates to the Nico van der Meel's operatic roles:
1. Auden and Kallman start by describing the eight paintings and engravings, and how Stravinsky had seen them.
2. They mention that the paintings and engravings are based on the ""Progress"" of a rake.

In the Good Dinosaur, the voice of the narrator is that of Jane Fonda, who is a Canadian-New Zealand actress who has done a number of significant roles in films including The Man Who Wasn't There. Fonda's voice was quite distinctive and was described as 'the most beautiful, the most powerful'.

To verify the answer, I looked up Jane Fonda on IMDb and it said she was born in the Canadian province of New Brunswick, Canada. This matches the Canadian-New Zealand actress part of the question. I also looked up the voice part and found this description from the Good Dinosaur script:

The narrator speaks with a Canadian accent, and his voice is
  occasionally a whisper, as he mutters out the script.

This matches the Good Dinosaur's description of the narrator's voice.

Generally speaking, federal courts do not have the power to make changes to common law in diversity cases because they do not have the jurisdiction to do so. However, there are cases where the federal government is found to have power to make common law changes in diversity cases.

The ruling in the Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins case was that the plaintiff’s claim for $500,000 was valid and that the defendants’ claims for $300,000 and $200,000 were not valid because they were not based on actual damages.

The high school was renamed in 1922 for the graduating class it would be a year after the school's inception.

The question is not very clear and the answer is not very specific. The context of the question is that the high school went under a new name in 1922, but the question is asking about the first graduating class and the answer is saying that it was a year after the school's inception. This is not accurate, as the first graduating class was not a year after the school's inception but a year before its rename.

To answer the question truthfully, the first graduating class would be 1921. The school was founded in 1912 and its first graduating class would be from 1921 to 1922.
